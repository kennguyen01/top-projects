This project is about replicating the Google home page.

## Review

I thought this project was simple but it took me a few hours to complete. The biggest difficulty I had was positioning the content. I had to use flexbox extensively for positioning the main navigation bar and the footer navigation. Aligning the footer flush to the bottom of the page also required using grid rows for the body. Grid was also very helpful in aligning the logo and search box since they are actually not at the center of the page.
