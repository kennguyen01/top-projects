## About

## Review

At first I was a bit overwhelmed because I wasn't sure how to approach the problem. I was overestimating how long it would take me to complete the project. However, the interactvity between HTML/CSS and JavaScript made a lot of the logic became much easier to implement. Now I begin to understand why JavaScript is so intertwined with web development. I knew the idea when I started learning programming but it's not until I have some first hand experience that I appreciate the power of JavaScript more.
