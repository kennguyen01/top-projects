## About

This project is about creating a web calculator.

## Review

This project was the most difficult so far. It forced to think about the logic behind each operation and how they interact with each other. I was stuck the longest on how to allow user to input a number right after an operation without any additional operation. I had to step through each conditional one by one to make sure that I don't break some functionality while fixing that bug. Overall it was a good project and I learned a lot about manipulating events and conditionals.
