# Rock Paper Scissors

## About

This project is about creating a script to play rock paper scissors against the computer.

## Review

This project was straightforward. The first thing I learned is that JS does not have a library to just get a random value out of an array. In Python, it was as simple as `random.choice(list)`. The second thing I learned is documenting with JSDoc. I spent an hour or so going over the basics to have something for me to look at later once I come back to this project.

The last thing I did was playing around with different methods of solving this problem. There are things in JS that was different from Python so I had to use the simplest way to solve things. I don't know enough about the language yet so it's best to just stick to the basics.
